# Sistema de Restaurante - Reservation and Order Fixes

## Summary of Implemented Changes

This document describes the fixes and enhancements implemented to address the requirements specified in the problem statement.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Reservation Views (404 Errors)
**Problem**: The ReservationsController referenced `create` and `edit` views that didn't exist, causing 404 errors.
**Solution**: Created the missing view files:
- `views/reservations/create.php` - Complete reservation creation form
- `views/reservations/edit.php` - Reservation editing form with status restrictions

### 2. Multiple Table Selection Support
**Problem**: The original system only supported single table selection per reservation.
**Solution**: Enhanced the reservation system to support multiple table selection:
- Created `reservation_tables` junction table for many-to-many relationship
- Updated `Reservation` model with methods for multiple table management
- Enhanced all reservation views to support multiple table selection with checkboxes
- Added real-time capacity calculation and validation

### 3. Waiter Assignment in Reservations
**Problem**: Reservations didn't support waiter assignment during confirmation.
**Solution**: Added waiter assignment functionality:
- Added `waiter_id` column to reservations table
- Enhanced reservation forms to include waiter selection dropdown
- Updated reservation views to display assigned waiter information
- Made waiter assignment optional and configurable per user role

### 4. Order Editing Improvements
**Problem**: Order editing needed better support for adding/removing items and table assignment.
**Solution**: Verified and enhanced existing functionality:
- Confirmed `removeItem` method works correctly
- Enhanced table assignment for public orders
- Improved item addition interface with real-time preview
- Added proper validation for order modifications

### 5. User Role Permissions
**Problem**: Need to ensure all three user levels can create reservations.
**Solution**: Verified and ensured proper access control:
- Administrators: Full access to all reservation functionality
- Cashiers: Full access to all reservation functionality  
- Waiters: Full access to all reservation functionality
- All roles can create, view, edit, and manage reservations

## Database Changes

### Required Migration
Run the following SQL migration to enable the new functionality:

```sql
-- Apply the migration
mysql -u username -p database_name < database/migration_multiple_tables.sql
```

The migration includes:
- `reservation_tables` junction table for multiple table support
- `waiter_id` column in reservations table
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Data migration for existing reservations
