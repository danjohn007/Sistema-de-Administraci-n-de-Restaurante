# Restaurant System Improvements - User Guide

## Overview
This document describes the new functionality implemented in the restaurant management system.

## New Features

### 1. Fixed CREATE ORDER Button
**Problem Fixed:** The CREATE ORDER button was getting stuck after clicking when in fixed mode.

**Solution:** 
- Changed button behavior to prevent double-submission
- Added loading state feedback
- Improved event handling for better user experience

**How to Use:**
- The button will now show "Creando..." while processing
- Button becomes disabled after first click to prevent duplicates
- Automatic re-enabling if form validation fails

### 2. Table Blocking for Waiters
**Feature:** Prevents multiple waiters from taking orders on the same table simultaneously.

**How it Works:**
- Tables are available to all waiters initially
- When a waiter creates an order, the table becomes blocked for that waiter only
- Other waiters cannot create orders on blocked tables
- Table is unblocked when tickets are generated

**User Experience:**
- Waiters see error message: "La mesa está ocupada por [Waiter Name]. Solo el mesero asignado puede agregar pedidos a esta mesa."
- Admins and cashiers can override this restriction

### 3. Ticket Separation by Customer
**Feature:** Generate separate tickets for each customer when a table has multiple orders.

**How to Use:**
1. Go to "Generar Ticket" 
2. Select a table with multiple orders
3. Check "Separar tickets por cliente" checkbox
4. Click "Generar Ticket"
5. System creates one ticket per customer automatically

**Benefits:**
- Each customer gets their own ticket
- Easier billing for groups
- Better customer service

### 4. Admin-Only Ticket Cancellation
**Feature:** Only administrators can cancel tickets, with mandatory reason entry.

**How to Use:**
1. Admin navigates to ticket list
2. Clicks on "Cancelar" (previously "Eliminar")
3. Fills out mandatory cancellation reason
4. Confirms cancellation

**What Happens:**
- Order status reverts to "Listo"
- Customer statistics are adjusted
- Inventory is restored (if applicable)
- Income is deducted from system
- Cancellation reason is permanently logged

### 5. Reservation 30-Minute Blocking
**Feature:** Tables are automatically blocked 30 minutes before reservation time.

**How it Works:**
- System checks for reservations when creating orders
- Tables become unavailable 30 minutes before reservation
- Only administrators and cashiers can override this block
- Waiters see warning: "La mesa está bloqueada por una reservación de [Customer] a las [Time]"

**Override Process:**
- Admin/Cashier can force unblock table
- Action is logged for audit purposes
- Reason must be provided for unblocking

### 6. Enhanced Menu Price Visualization
**Feature:** Improved price display for better visibility.

**Improvements:**
- Larger font sizes for prices
- Color-coded price displays
- Better contrast and highlighting
- Different styles for different contexts:
  - `.price-display`: Standard enhanced price
  - `.price-large`: Large prominent price
  - `.price-menu-item`: Highlighted menu prices with background

## Database Migrations Required

Run these SQL scripts on your database before using the new features:

1. **Ticket Cancellation:** `database/migration_ticket_cancellation.sql`
   - Adds cancellation fields to tickets table

2. **Reservation Blocking:** `database/migration_reservation_blocking.sql`
   - Adds table unblock logging

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Methods Added

**Ticket Model:**
- `createSeparateTicketsByCustomer()` - Creates individual tickets per customer
- `cancelTicket()` - Handles admin ticket cancellation
- `revertInventoryForCancelledTicket()` - Restores inventory on cancellation

**Customer Model:**
- `revertStats()` - Reverts customer statistics on ticket cancellation

**Reservation Model:**
- `getTablesBlockedByReservations()` - Gets currently blocked tables
- `isTableBlockedByReservation()` - Checks if specific table is blocked
- `canUseTable()` - Determines if user can use table
- `forceUnblockTable()` - Admin override for table blocking

### Security Considerations

- Only administrators can cancel tickets
- Cancellation reasons are mandatory and logged
- Table unblocking by admin/cashier is logged
- All actions maintain audit trail

### User Role Permissions

**Waiter:**
- Cannot use tables blocked by other waiters

- Cannot cancel tickets

**Cashier:**
