# Order Editing Fixes Documentation

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve order editing issues in the Restaurant Management System.

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Table Assignment Should Be Optional for Public Orders (Non-Pickup)

**Problem**: When editing orders from the public page (not Pickup), table assignment was required, which shouldn't be the case for public orders.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `validateOrderInput` method in `OrdersController.php` to detect public orders and make table assignment optional
- Updated the edit form to show a table selection dropdown for public orders
- Added customer information display for better order identification

**Files Modified**:
- `controllers/OrdersController.php` - Updated validation logic
- `views/orders/edit.php` - Added conditional table assignment form

### Issue 2: Status Change Shows Wrong Order and Doesn't Save Correctly

**Problem**: When changing order status in 'view details', the wrong order was displayed on the left side and status changes weren't saved to the correct order.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `getOrdersWithDetails` method in `Order.php` to properly handle 'id' filter
- Updated status update redirects to return to the same order for consistency
- Ensured order retrieval targets the correct order

**Files Modified**:
- `models/Order.php` - Added missing 'id' filter handling
- `controllers/OrdersController.php` - Updated redirect behavior

### Issue 3: Adding New Items Shows Wrong Order and Doesn't Save Correctly

**Problem**: When adding new items while editing an order, the left side loaded the last order instead of the selected one, and new items weren't saved to the correct order.

**Solution**:
- Ensured `processEdit` method consistently uses the provided order ID
- Verified `addItemToOrder` method targets the specified order ID
- Added proper error handling that maintains order context

**Files Modified**:
- `controllers/OrdersController.php` - Enhanced processEdit method

### Issue 4: Additional Improvements

**Additional Features Added**:
- Added `removeItem` functionality for order editing
- Enhanced order display with customer information for public orders
- Improved form handling and user experience
- Added comprehensive test coverage

**Files Modified**:
- `controllers/OrdersController.php` - Added removeItem method
- `views/orders/edit.php` - Enhanced UI for better order identification
- `test_order_editing.php` - Added comprehensive testing

## Implementation Details

### Public Order Detection

The system now detects public orders by checking for customer information:

```php
$isPublicOrder = !empty($order['customer_name']) || !empty($order['customer_phone']);
```

### Table Assignment Logic

For public orders (non-pickup), table assignment is optional:

```php
// Table is required for internal orders and pickup orders
if (!$isPublicOrder || $isPickup) {
    $errors = $this->validateInput($data, [
        'table_id' => ['required' => true]
    ]);
}
```

### Order Retrieval Fix

Fixed the missing 'id' filter in `getOrdersWithDetails`:

```php
if (isset($filters['id'])) {
    $conditions[] = "o.id = ?";
    $params[] = $filters['id'];
}
```

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
php test_order_editing.php
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Public Order Table Assignment**:
   - Create a public order without table assignment
   - Edit the order and verify table assignment is optional
   - Assign a table and verify it saves correctly

2. **Status Update Consistency**:
   - Open an order's details page
   - Change the status and verify it updates the correct order
   - Verify the page shows the same order after update

3. **New Item Addition**:
   - Edit an order and add new items
   - Verify the items are added to the correct order
   - Check that the order information remains consistent

4. **Item Removal**:
   - Remove items from an order
   - Verify the order total updates correctly
   - Ensure the correct order is maintained

## Database Compatibility

All changes maintain compatibility with SQLite and MySQL databases. The fixes work with the existing database schema and the public orders migration:

- `migration_public_orders.sql` - Adds public order fields
- `migration_optional_table_id.sql` - Makes table_id nullable

## Security Considerations

- All order operations maintain proper permission checks
- Waiters can only edit orders assigned to them
- Admins and cashiers can edit any order
- Input validation prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks

## Performance Impact

The changes have minimal performance impact:
- Added one condition check in validation
- Single additional filter in database query
- No new database queries or heavy operations

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing orders continue to work normally
- Internal order creation remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to the API or database structure
